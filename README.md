# w3schools.com Browser Data

This data comes from browser information from users who visit w3schools.com. You can view more information in the [Sources section](https://github.com/zonination/w3data/blob/master/README.md#sources) below.

The data on the source pages were copied, and then formatted into a machine-readable spreadsheet.

## About

Inspired by [This Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3s3c8o/relative_operating_system_market_share_from_2003/) as well as observing [an image](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Operatingsystem_market_share.svg) on [this Wikipedia page](http://archive.is/P2LK3), I wanted to make the following improvements:

* Group OS families by color.
* Force an area plot.
* Expanding the data set to most recent available.

Since the data included browser information as well, I decided to plot browser market share in addition.
